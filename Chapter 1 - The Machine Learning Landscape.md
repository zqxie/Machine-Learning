### Machine Learning Usage
 - Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of **hand-tuning** or **long lists of rules**: Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.
 - Complex problems for which there is **no good solution at all using a traditional approach**: Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
 - Fluctuating environment: a Machine Learning System can **adapt to new data**
 - Getting **insights** about complex problems and large amount of data
