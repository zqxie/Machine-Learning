# Data Overview
 - Wage Data: Supervised, Association between Wage and the employee's age, education, as well as calendar year
 - Stock Market: Supervised, Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P) stock index over a 5-year period between 2001 and 2005
 - Gene Expression: Unsupervised, NGI60, a data set consisting of 6830 gene expression measurements for each of 64 cancer cell lines
 
# A brief History of Statistical Learnign
 - 19th century, Legendre and Gauss, *method of least squares*, known as *linear regression*
 - 1936, Fisher, *linear discriminant analysis*; 1940s, *logistic regression*
 - 1970s, Nelder and Wedderburn, *generalized linear models*, including linear and logistic regression as special cases
 - 1980s, Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and Stone, *classification and regression trees*, *cross-validation*
 - 1986, Hastie and Tibshirani, *generalized additive models*, non-linear extensions to generalized linear models
 
# Important Premises
 - Many statistical learning methods are relevant and useful in a wide range of academic and non-academic disciplines, beyond just the statistical sciences.
 - Statistical learning should not be viewed as a series of black boxes. We should know the **model, intuition, assumption, and trade-offs** behind each of the methods that we consider
 - It is not necessary to have the skills to construct the machine inside the box. Basic mathematical concepts and being familiar with softwares are enough to implement these methods
 - Be interested in applying statistical learning methods to real-world problems
